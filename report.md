Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are marine mammals primarily found in the Arctic regions surrounding the North Pole. They're distinct for their white fur, which provides camouflage in their icy environment, and their thick layer of fat, which insulates against the extreme cold. Polar bears are skilled swimmers, often covering large distances in search of food. They primarily feed on seals, which they hunt by waiting patiently at seal holes or breaks in the ice.

Polar bears are classified as 'vulnerable' due to the impact of climate change on their sea ice habitats. As the Arctic ice diminishes, it threatens their ability to hunt and reproduce. Conservation efforts are in place to study polar bear populations and develop strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change, such as establishing protected areas and reducing industrial impacts in critical habitats.

Key protective measures include international agreements like the Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears, signed in 1973 by countries with polar bear populations. This aims to protect ecosystems, manage human-polar bear conflicts, and conduct research to ensure the species' survival. Continued global efforts are essential to address climate change and secure a future for these iconic Arctic predators.
