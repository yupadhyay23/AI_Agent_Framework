Subject: Quick Chat Over Drinks?

Hey Jane,

I hope you're having a great day! I was thinking it might be nice to unwind a bit after work. Would you be interested in grabbing a drink with me today? It could be a great chance to kick back and catch up outside of the office. Let me know what you think!

Best,  
John
